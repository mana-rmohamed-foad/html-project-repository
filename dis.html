<h1>Disadvantages of artificial intelligence </h1>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"> Depite the many advantages of artificial intelligence and technological development, this development has many disadvantages <br>
such as that it may replace many human jops,which leads to increase the unemploymemt rate.<br>
Many studies have been issued to study this problem and economistsâ€™s estimates confirm that reliance in industry on technological workers instead<br>
of  the human factor would increase the unemploymemt rate to 50%.<br>
Studies in the united states say that jops in the united states may be threatened by robots in the next 15 years....A study conducted at Oxford <br>
university in 2013 concluded that 702 jops in the united states can be performed by machine about 47%.   </font>
